                <p>Hi! I'm Ariana, but most people call me I am Will, short for William Shakespeareâ€”a nickname I received in grade nine that stuck. I am a tri-racial Canadian mixed with Jamaican, Uruguayan, and Argintinian. I have lived in Canada most of my life, with the exception of 6 months in Egypt.</p>

                <p>I have many hobbies, many of which are art-based. I love painting, drawing, crocheting, photography, and writing. My artistic abilities allow me to be creative in many art mediums.</p>

                <p>I'm currently a high school student enrolled in an online and private school, but I was previously homeschooled, so I'm often considered quite the introvert; this can be good, as I have time to thrive in school settings. My MBTI personality type is an INTP, which matches my inquisitive nature and deep passion when speaking about topics of interest.</p> 

                <p>I attend two sports weekly: swimming and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. My love of sports is evident in the fact that I have done over ten different sports! Additionally, I am well-traveled, having been to three continents with many more on the destination list. I also have calmer interests, like watching TV shows and reading. I am also particularly interested in graphic design; my latest interest has been attempting to figure out CSS animation.</p>

                <p>My aspirations are as ambitious as I am. I plan to become a neuroscientist, focusing on cognitive and developmental neuroscience in those with neurodivergence. As someone with severe ADHD and other neurodivergence, this topic is significant to me. Being able to study and help the world understand neurodivergent brains is super exciting! In addition, I am interested in computer science and would like to find a middle ground. Balancing both fields may be challenging, but I am excited to take it on.</p>
