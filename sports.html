                <p>Throughout my life, I have been deeply involved in various sports, each shaping my character and skills. My journey includes—but is not limited to—swimming, basketball, gymnastics, horseback riding, hockey, martial arts, skiing, and soccer. Here's a closer look at my experiences in these sports.

                <span>Swimming stands out as one of my most accomplished sports. I have completed almost all the levels more than once due to travelling. Currently, I am at an advanced level and plan to earn my Bronze Medallion this summer! My swimming journey hasn't been without challenges, and I quit twice after getting very sick, but my drive to finish has pushed me to keep coming back.</span>

                <span>Basketball has been a beloved sport throughout my life. I played whenever possible and joined a team at the beginning of 2020 to hone my skills and prepare for our first game. Unfortunately, the game was cancelled a week before due to COVID-19, but my passion for the sport remains strong.</span>

                <span>I did gymnastics from 2013 to 2015, resulting in me completing three levels and heading into the fourth in 2015. I ended up stopping due to the lack of privacy at the gym, but afterwards, I continued to train my flexibility at home, and I'm considered quite flexible :)</span>

                <span>Martial arts have been a significant part of my life, fueling my excitement to learn self-defence. While I have practiced various forms including Karate, Taekwondo, and Kali, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the one I have pursued the longest. Currently, I practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu weekly.</span>

                <span>My mom mainly taught me soccer since she played on a professional team as a teen, but around 2019, she put me in a soccer program, where I learned a lot about soccer and scored some pretty neat goals.</span>

                <p>My journey through these sports has developed my physical abilities and taught me resilience, discipline, and teamwork. Each sport holds a special place in my heart and continues to shape who I am today. Currently, I'm looking into track and field and hoping to find somewhere I can learn!</p>
